# Flexbox Challenge 1 #

In the lesson on day 8, Kevin Powell in his free course Conquering Responsive Layouts (21-day Challenge) gave a challenge, namely Flexbox Challenge 1.

The layout continues the challenges in the previous lesson.

Initially I did what I had in mind to complete this challenge. but, after watching the solution video, I changed according to the directions in the solution. no problem, because the solution is very good and effective. :thumbsup:

__What I learned from the lessons in this section on day 8:__

If there are several flexbox sections that are similar but the section has a different style from the other sections, wrap them again in HTML elements with different classes.

in this case, there are 2 `.row` which have different styles. therefore each `.row` is wrapped in a `<section>` HTML element with a different class name. first `.three-col`, second `.two-col`.
